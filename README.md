# Spitbol and SNOBOL4 TextMate Grammar Highlighting

A .tmLanguage extension for the Spitbol and SNOBOL4 programming languages- for usage in Sublime, VsCode, etc!

Note this contains all the functions and keywords that are found in Spitbol.  As Spitbol is essentially a superset of SNOBOL4; I feel it is reasonable to classify this grammar as compatible with both programming languages.

There is definitely some rooms for improvement, but far as I know this is the only tmLanguage extension for the language.
